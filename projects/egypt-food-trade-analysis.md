# Egypt Food Trade Analysis

**Role:** Lead Analyst/Economist    
**Timeframe:** Completed in 2025, with data covering 2014-2024  
**Tools:** Stata, replicated in R  
**Methods:** Trade data analysis, synthetic control methodology

## Summary
This project analyzed trends of Egypt’s agri-food trade to understand how a policy change affected export and import performance.

## Context
In 2019, Egypt implemented a unified food safety regulatory framework covering the agri-food supply chain. This project analyzes changes in Egypt’s international agri-food trade following the reform, using synthetic control methods to compare observed outcomes with data-driven counterfactuals.

## Data
- **Sources:** UN Comtrade
- **Unit of analysis:** 2-digit-level Harmonized System (HS) bilateral trade flows
- **Key variables:** Trade values, partner countries, commodity groups

## Approach
- Descriptive trend analysis of imports and exports
- Econometric analysis based on the synthetic control methodology linking trade patterns to the policy change

## Key Results
Exports show meaningful policy effects emerging in 2023–2024, with treatment estimates turning positive and statistically significant, reaching about $1.02 billion in 2024 (roughly 15% of total exports, significant at the 10% level).Imports exhibit no statistically significant effects throughout the evaluation period; although point estimates are positive and may suggest improved import facilitation, the evidence does not support a causal attribution to the intervention.
